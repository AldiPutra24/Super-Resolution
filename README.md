# Super Resolution and Down Resolution Image Processingüîç

This repository contains implementations for enhancing image resolution (Super Resolution) and reducing image resolution (Down Resolution). These techniques are crucial for improving image quality in various applications, including photography, medical imaging, and more.

## Overview
- Super Resolution: Uses deep learning models to upscale low-resolution images, enhancing detail and clarity.
- Down Resolution: Reduces the resolution of high-resolution images for efficient storage and processing, while maintaining as much visual fidelity as possible.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AldiPutra24/Super-Resolution.git

## References
This project is inspired by the [TensorFlow Hub Image Enhancing tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/image_enhancing), which provides a comprehensive guide to improving image resolution using deep learning.
